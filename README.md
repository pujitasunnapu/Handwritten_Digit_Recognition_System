# üß† Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

A Deep Learning Model to Accurately Classify Digits from Images (MNIST Dataset)

---

## ‚ùì Business Questions

* How can we automate digit recognition for scanned handwritten forms and documents?
* Can a neural network match or exceed human-level accuracy in recognizing digits?
* What architecture best balances high accuracy with computational efficiency?
* How does the model perform on real-world handwriting, not just curated datasets?
* What mistakes does the model make, and why?

## ‚ö° TL;DR ‚Äì Summary of How I Solved It

* Built a **deep CNN** model using Keras with LeakyReLU, Dropout, BatchNorm, and MaxPooling
* Preprocessed and split the **MNIST dataset** into training, validation, and test sets
* Achieved **>99.4% test accuracy** with no significant overfitting
* Evaluated using accuracy/loss plots, confusion matrix, and real handwritten images
* Included **top-2 prediction logic** for interpretability and edge-case handling

## üíº Outcome / Business Value

* Achieves near-perfect digit classification: **99.4% test accuracy**
* Reduces manual data entry for digit-based forms like:

  * Bank checks
  * Exam sheets
  * Zip codes or IDs in scanned forms
* Demonstrates a reusable pipeline for document digitization and OCR pre-processing
* Can be extended to full OCR solutions or mobile image classification apps
